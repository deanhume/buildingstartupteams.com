              The excerpt below is from Chapter 9 and is entitled <em>"The cost of losing an employee"</em>.
              <br>
              <br>
              Your organisation may be a wonderful place to work, but the reality is that people will eventually leave and move on. This is inevitable due to the natural ebb and flow of human movement, but there will be times when you can do something to prevent someone from leaving. The sad part is that many organisations and managers don’t realise the impact of losing an employee.
              The impact doesn’t stop with the loss of knowledge.
              <br>
              <br>
              A recent analysis by Oxford Economics found that it takes 28 weeks on average to bring a new hire up to speed, even with the best onboarding programme in the world, it still takes time for a new person to contribute to the team. Moreover, Oxford Economics found that the loss of an employee carries with it a financial impact of over £30,000 ($45,000). This analysis took into account both the time it takes for a new hire to become productive and all the costs associated with attracting and hiring new talent.
              Let’s take that number and imagine the following scenario. At Acme Corp., six employees leave over a period of one year. If we add that up, it would cost around £180,000 ($270,000) to replace them! This number doesn’t even take into account the many interviews and long hours involved in hiring for those six positions again.
              <br>
              <br>
              I’ve heard senior executives repeat the saying, “everyone is replaceable”, and while this may be a harsh, blunt way of looking at things, it doesn’t take into account the cost involved or the cultural aspect of that loss. If you’ve been hiring for a cultural fit as we discussed in chapter 2, the loss of an employee will bring with it things that money can’t buy. There will be times when the loss of an employee will be out of your hands, but in the modern world of startups, losing employees is an expense that a fledgling company cannot afford!
